description: Session startup - load context and identify focus
---

Think OS session startup. Execute the following:

1. **Read core context**:
   - `memory/me.md` — who is this person
   - `now.md` — current focus
   - `memory/timeline/todo.md` — pending tasks

2. **Check recent activity**:
   - Read the most recent file in `memory/timeline/daily/`
   - Note any open threads from previous session

3. **Output a brief summary**:
   - Current priorities
   - Any open threads to continue
   - Pending todos

4. **Ask**: "What would you like to focus on today?"
