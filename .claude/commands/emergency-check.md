description: Emergency check - reality check deadlines and buffers
---

Review all deadlines and ensure you have enough buffer.

## 1. Gather deadlines

Read `memory/timeline/todo.md` and `memory/timeline/perspective.md` for any deadlines or time-sensitive goals.

## 2. For each deadline, check:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is it? | |
| When is it due? | |
| Days remaining? | |
| Working days remaining? (exclude weekends) | |
| Started yet? | |
| Estimated time needed? | |
| Buffer enough? | |

## 3. Flag issues

- 🚨 **Red**: Buffer already gone, need immediate action
- ⚠️ **Yellow**: Buffer tight, need attention
- ✅ **Green**: On track

## 4. Output format

```
🔍 Emergency Check — {date}

## Deadlines

| Deadline | Due | Days left | Status |

## Flags

🚨 **[Issue]**
- What's the problem
- What needs to happen

## Today's Priority

Based on the above, what should be the #1 focus today?
```

## 5. Ask

"Based on this, what do you want to focus on today?"
